# imap-notify-discord-bot

## What is it?

imap-notify-discord-bot is a discord bot that sends a ping to a discord channel when you get an email.

That's it. That's the whole thing.

## Installation & Use
 
 * Download the code (either clone the repo or just download the zip above) and NodeJS
 * If you downloaded a zip, extract it to it's own folder
 * Install dependencies with `npm i`
 * Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json`
 * Make a Discord bot with their developer console, and copy the token into your `config.json`
 * Invite your bot to your discord server, and copy the Channel id to `config.json` as well as your own User id
 * Make an application password in GMail and copy that and your email address into your `config.json`
 * Then run the bot with `node index`

## ... Why?

Because I kept missing emails, and I decided other people might find it useful. You should probably only use it on servers where you're the only human.

### Why do you have one of those...?

Ok, so, I used to be in a lot of discord servers for the express reason of being able to see their announcements channels. I didn't speak in them or anything, so I was like 'why not just make a server where they're all in one place?' and that's how Kd's Announcements Channels was born. ... No you can't join.
