# imap-notify-discord-bot

## What is it?

imap-notify-discord-bot is a discord bot that sends a ping to a discord channel when you get an email.

That's it. That's the whole thing.

## ... Why?

Because I kept missing emails, and I decided other people might find it useful. You should probably only use it on servers where you're the only human.

### Why do you have one of those...?

Ok, so, I used to be in a lot of discord servers for the express reason of being able to see their announcements channels. I didn't speak in them or anything, so I was like 'why not just make a server where they're all in one place?' and that's how Kd's Announcements Channels was born. ... No you can't join.
